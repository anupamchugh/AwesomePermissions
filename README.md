# AwesomePermissions
A fix for the Easy Permissions Alert Dialog
The cancel button didn't have an listener in the Easy Permissions Library.
This library fixes that.

#Setup
repositories {
			maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
		}
    
    dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.anupamchugh:AwesomePermissions:1.2'
	}
